The project is a Streamlit web application that compares resumes to a job description to
assist hiring managers or recruiters in sorting through applications. Users have the option to upload
many resumes in PDF format as well as a job description. The programme uses pdfplumber to
handle the text content that has been extracted from the submitted files. Then it checks the degree
of similarity between each resume and the job description. Then it calculated using the cosine
similarity method. We have two categories. Appropriate Resumes: Resumes deemed appropriate
have a match rate of at least 50%. These resumes are listed in the application along with the
percentage of matches. Then we have Non-Appropriate Resumes: Resumes that do not fit into the
job description as closely are indicated by a match percentage of 50% or less, which is presented
separately. The programme shows a spinner to show that it is operating while the processing data.
If there is any problem in processing the files, it also gives warnings.
Overall, the application provides a convenient way to quickly filter through a large number of
resumes and identify those that best match a given job description based on textual similarity.












The software has successfully categorised suitable and not suitable resumes of job applicants compare to ideal job description of Hiring Manager.
